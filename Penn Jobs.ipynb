      "Summary : Ray-finned fishes are represented by 30000 living species and have a fossil record dating back 400 million years. Despite this diversity, the exact relationships between living and extinct forms remain poorly known. This prevents us from testing hypotheses about the origins of major groups (like teleosts, including cichlids, tuna and salmon), the responses of fishes to  the spread and alteration of important traits (tooth type, body sizes, swimming ability), and the construction of modern marine ecosystems. However, information on the relationships of smaller fossil and modern ray-fin groups is spread throughout the literature. The aim of this project is to assemble this scattered data to construct a \"super tree\" containing nearly all living and extinct fishes, revealing the full history of diversification.\n",

The mission of CSH is to support, educate and advocate for vulnerable persons with surgical diseases. Our vision is to create a sustainable infrastructure through which all members of our community can access high-quality surgical care. CSH is committed to building an academic community of interdisciplinary scholars who support each other’s intellectual curiosity and progression within the surgical equity space. CSH recognizes that changing the landscape of surgical care for vulnerable populations requires a multipronged approach, including improving access to surgical consultation and operative intervention, interdisciplinary public health and clinical outcomes research, curriculum development surrounding the social determinants of surgical health, and, advocacy efforts to inform policy change at the local, state, national and international levels. As a result, CSH is organized into four divisions: The Clinics, The Research Lab, The Classroom and the Policy Lab. \n",

It could be as few as 8 hour per week or up to 15 hours a week (3 hours per day M-F).We are looking for someone who is (ideally) studying to be an educator and who feels confident in their ability to familiarize themselves with the materials that will be taught in 6th and 8th grade at Penn Charter (we will assist with getting you access).  This individual will work with each student to support them in their studies, as needed.
