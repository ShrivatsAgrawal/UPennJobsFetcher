# UPennJobsFetcher
#### Why the need arose? 


I am attending Univeristy of Pennsylvania in Fall 2021 for the program Masters in Data Science. 
I wanted to look at all the job opportunities I could pursue along with my program at one glance and also sort or filter them on criterions such as Job Description, hourly pay, number of hours per week or weekly pay.
This script was created to provide a solution to this need.

This script neatly condenses all the listed jobs on University of Pennsylvania's official jobs portal into one Excel Sheet sorted in descending order of Weekly Pay. 

Fields such as Job Tile, Summary, Job Details, Date of Posting the job, contact information, hourly pay, number of weeks per hour and Weekly Pay which are included in the Excel file help to review all the job opportunities quickly and in one place.
